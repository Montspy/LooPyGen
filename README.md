This is the unofficial Loopring Python Image Generator and Minter on Layer 2.

⚠️ **NEVER SHARE YOUR PRIVATE KEY OR API KEY WITH ANYONE** ⚠️

The system utilizes a few parts:

1. Python to generate images and metadata according to the standards for the new Layer 2 marketplace.
2. NodeJS to pre-calculate CIDs on images and metadata files.
3. Python to run the batch minting and transfer processes.
4. PHP to tie everything together.
