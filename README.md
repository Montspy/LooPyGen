# LooPyMint2

This is the unofficial Loopring Python Minter on Layer 2. Don't be fooled, this tool does much more than just minting!

The system utilizes a few parts:

1. Python to generate images and metadata according to the standards for the new Layer 2 marketplace.
2. NodeJS to pre-calculate CIDs on images and metadata files.
3. Python to run the batch minting process.
